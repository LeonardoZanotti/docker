# Docker

## Understanding Docker
The principal news about Docker is that Docker let us group an application or a collection of services in containers, so, we can access all the services by accessing the container (we will talk about generating a container wich many services in [Docker compose page](https://leonardozanotti.github.io/docker/docker-compose/)).

Basically, a docker container is an example of application that has all the librarys and components needed to an application works.

For a pratice point of view, a container is like a reduced virtual machine that works regardless of an operational system where a specific application or service is executed.

A docker container is generated by an image, which is the result of an application or group of services. It can have a complete operating system or several applications installed.

We also can create an image, which we will see in this article too (see [Create your own image page](https://leonardozanotti.github.io/docker/your-own-image/)).


You can find some images to run in docker in the [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).

<br>

### Test
If your docker is correctly installed you can run this to test it:
```bash
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

<br>

### Images
Search for images, then you can download the with the pull command (see ahead):
```bash
$ sudo docker search [search_query]
```

As example, if you want to search for Debian images you can use:
```bash
$ sudo docker search debian
```

Download an image to your machine:
```bash
$ sudo docker pull [image_name]
# Example: sudo docker pull debian
```

Remove and image from your machine:
```bash
$ docker rmi image_name_or_ID
```

List images already downloaded:
```bash
$ sudo docker images
```

Run the image to create the container:
```bash
$ sudo docker run -it [image]
# The -it instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the containerâ€™s stdin,
# creating an interactive bash shell in the container.
```
You can end the image running using `CTRL + D`.

<br>

### Containers
You can list the containers running using:
```bash
$ docker ps -a      # use -qa to list only the id
```

You can stop the container running with:
```bash
$ sudo docker stop container_ID
```

To start it again:
```bash
$ sudo docker start container_ID
```

You can remove an container using:
```bash
$ docker rm container_ID
```

You can execute commands in the container terminal with:
```bash
$ sudo docker exec -it container_name_or_ID /bin/bash
```

<br>

### More commands
You can find more commands using just:
```bash
$ docker
```

Or, to see the help for a specific command:
```bash
$ docker docker-subcommand --help
```
